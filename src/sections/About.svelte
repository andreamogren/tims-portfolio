            <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Tim and I'm currently a student at Xenter's 3D-Technician program. I aspire to become someone with a broad understanding of the field that I'm working in. At my future workplace my goal will be that machines never stay broken and are kept in tip top condition. I'm a curious nerd that loves games and even more to cook. Mexican is my cuisine of choice.</p>
